Start project:
```
npm run dev
```

Rebuild your project

Run this in your terminal:

npm run build


This regenerates the dist folder — it contains the new, updated version of your site.

Replace your /docs content with the new build

Open your dist/ folder

Select everything inside it (Ctrl + A → Copy)

Go to your docs/ folder

Delete all old files

Paste the new ones from dist

Now your docs contains the latest version of your site.
